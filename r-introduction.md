R section of the course aimed to introduce you the R Programming and share the resources that you can study in the future. R section will be relatively small compared to Matlab and Python sections. It is because that R programming is more efficient for *statistical analysis*. However, most of you are not familiar with the econometrics techniques. 

First of all check out [RStudio installation for Anaconda](https://itueconomics.github.io/bil113e/anaconda-install/).

If you would like to study from textbooks you can use Emmanuel Paradis' [R for Beginners](https://itueconomics.github.io/bil113e/assets/R-for-beginners.pdf) online-free textbook. 

However, interactive courses are available for both Python and R to study. It is easier to motivate yourself through those courses. Checkout:

- [edX: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linear-models-matrix-harvardx-ph525-2x-2)

Some of the courses demand fee for certificates but you can `audit` the courses. 

*The first-listed course is, I think, is the most efficient for an introduction course.* 

You can download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) separately from Anaconda. Note that you must first download and install R, and then RStudio.
