I am studying Mal-Colell's Microeconomics Theory, Chapter 3: Classical Demand Theory for my Economics master thesis. I will try to gather my notes on this blog for myself and for others who wants to understand theoretical framework in this chapter. By the end of the blog, I might share my findings related with my thesis.
