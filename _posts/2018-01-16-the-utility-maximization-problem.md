Now it is time to solve consumer's decision problem. 

The problem, simple, have two parameters:

1. Consumer wants to maximize its utility,
2. Consumer have budget constraint

So, consumer can either maximize his or her utility or minimize the cost. 

Here we are starting with the Utility Maximization Problem:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x\ge 0}\quad & u(x) \\
s.t.\quad & p.x \le w.
\end{aligned}
$$
