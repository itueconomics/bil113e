\* *I will call Microeconomics Theory book as MT simply*

For the rest of this chapter there will be made additional assumptions to the *rationality* which is:

> Definition 3.B.1: The preference relation $ \succsim $ on $ X $ is *rational* if it possesses the following properties:
>
> 1. *Completeness*: For all $x, y \in X$, we have $x \succsim y $ or $ y \succsim x $ or both.
> 2. *Transitivity*: For all $x, y, z \in X$, if $x \succsim y $ and $ y \succsim z $ then $ x \succsim z $.



This statement is made in Chapter 1 of the book and repeated again. In addition to this assumption there will be two addition assumptions are introduced:

### Desirability Assumption ###

This assumptions implies two properties: (1) Monotonicity and (2) Local nonsatiation. 

> Definition 3.B.2: The preference relation $ \succsim $ on $ X $ is monotone if $ x \in X $ and $ y \gg x $ implies $ y \succ x $. It is strongly monotone if $ y \geq x $ implies that $ y \succ x $ . 

As stated in the MT, this assumption satisfied if the commodities are 'good'. Even so, 'bad' goods can be monotone depending on consumption bundle. 

> Definition 3.B.3: The preference relation $ \succsim $ on $ X $ is locally nonsatiated of for every $ x \in X $ and every $ \epsilon > 0 $, there is $ y \in X $ such that $ \mid \mid y -x \mid \mid \le \epsilon $.

This is more understandable from the graph.

**Interpretation:**  small distance of x, $ \epsilon $, there are consumption bundles $ y, z $ such that $ y \succ x$ and $ x \succ z $. We could have another consumption bundle $ l $ such that $ l \sim x $. So we can define the *upper contour* and *lower contour* sets within the distance of $ \epsilon $. 

### Convexity Assumption ###

Convexity is one of the most important assumption throughout the MT. It  implies *diminishing marginal rates of substitution*: 

> Definition 3.B.4: The preference relation $ \succsim $ on $ X $ is convex if for every $ x \in X $, the upper contour set $ \{ y \in X: y \succsim x\} $ is convex; that is, if $y \succsim x $ and $ z \succsim x $, then $ay + (1-a)z \succsim x $ for any $ a \in [0,1] $.

That means linear combination $ y $ and $ z $ is always preferred to $ x $.
