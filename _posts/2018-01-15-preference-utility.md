Consumer's preferences can be represented by utility function. By doing so, consumer's problem (preference) can be solved by math or computers. Existence of the utility function representing the consumers' preferences depends on the *continuity* assumption. 

> Definition 3.C.1: The preference relation $ \succsim $ on $ X $ is *continuous* if it is preserved under limits. That is, for any sequence of pairs $ \{(x^n , y^n)\}^\infty_{n=1}  $  with $ x^n \succsim y^n $ for all $ n $, $ x = \lim_{n\to\infty} x^n $ and $ y = \lim_{n\to-\infty} y^n $, we have $ x \succsim y $.

It means:  

1. There is no "jump". You can recall the continuous functions to understand this statement. Non-continuous functions would cause problems while maximization or minimization. So expect consumer's preferences to be continuous to be able to represent them with a continuous utility function.

2. Theoretically, it also means upper and lower contour sets are both closed. Indifference curve represent this boundary.

Continuity of $ \succsim $ is sufficient to ensure the existence of *continuous utility function*.
