  <p>In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training
Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment
are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand <strong>Neural Networks</strong> and how they are arranged in layered
architectures</li>
  <li>understand and be able to implement (vectorized) <strong>backpropagation</strong></li>
  <li>implement various <strong>update rules</strong> used to optimize Neural Networks</li>
  <li>implement <strong>batch normalization</strong> for training deep networks</li>
  <li>implement <strong>dropout</strong> to regularize networks</li>
  <li>effectively <strong>cross-validate</strong> and find the best hyperparameters for Neural
Network architecture</li>
  <li>understand the architecture of <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> and train
gain experience with training these models on data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>You can work on the assignment in one of two ways: locally on your own machine,
or on a virtual machine through Terminal.com.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-the-cloud-on-terminal">Working in the cloud on Terminal</h3>

<p>Terminal has created a separate subdomain to serve our class,
<a href="https://www.stanfordterminalcloud.com">www.stanfordterminalcloud.com</a>. Register
your account there. The Assignment 2 snapshot can then be found <a href="https://www.stanfordterminalcloud.com/snapshot/6c95ca2c9866a962964ede3ea5813d4c2410ba48d92cf8d11a93fbb13e08b76a">HERE</a>. If you are
registered in the class you can contact the TA (see Piazza for more information)
to request Terminal credits for use on the assignment. Once you boot up the
snapshot everything will be installed for you, and you will be ready to start on
your assignment right away. We have written a small tutorial on Terminal
<a href="/terminal-tutorial">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-locally">Working locally</h3>
<p>Get the code as a zip file
<a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments/2016/winter1516_assignment2.zip">here</a>.
As for the dependencies:</p>

<p><strong>[Option 1] Use Anaconda:</strong>
The preferred approach for installing all the assignment dependencies is to use
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>, which is a Python distribution
that includes many of the most popular Python packages for science, math,
engineering and data analysis. Once you install it you can skip all mentions of
requirements and you are ready to go directly to working on the assignment.</p>

<p><strong>[Option 2] Manual install, virtual environment:</strong>
If you do not want to use Anaconda and want to go with a more manual and risky
installation route you will likely want to create a
<a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">virtual environment</a>
for the project. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you
to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed globally on your
machine. To set up a virtual environment, run the following:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>assignment2
<span class="nb">sudo </span>pip <span class="nb">install </span>virtualenv      <span class="c"># This may already be installed</span>
virtualenv .env                  <span class="c"># Create a virtual environment</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> .env/bin/activate         <span class="c"># Activate the virtual environment</span>
pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> requirements.txt  <span class="c"># Install dependencies</span>
<span class="c"># Work on the assignment for a while ...</span>
deactivate                       <span class="c"># Exit the virtual environment</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Download data:</strong>
Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Run the following from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment2</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>cs231n/datasets
./get_datasets.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Compile the Cython extension:</strong> Convolutional Neural Networks require a very
efficient implementation. We have implemented of the functionality using
<a href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a>; you will need to compile the Cython extension
before you can run the code. From the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cs231n</code> directory, run the following
command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python setup.py build_ext <span class="nt">--inplace</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Start IPython:</strong>
After you have the CIFAR-10 data, you should start the IPython notebook server
from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment2</code> directory. If you are unfamiliar with IPython, you should 
read our <a href="/ipython-tutorial">IPython tutorial</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are working in a virtual environment on OSX, you may encounter
errors with matplotlib due to the
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html">issues described here</a>.
You can work around this issue by starting the IPython server using the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">start_ipython_osx.sh</code> script from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment2</code> directory; the script
assumes that your virtual environment is named <code class="highlighter-rouge">.env</code>.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-your-work">Submitting your work:</h3>
<p>Whether you work on the assignment locally or using Terminal, once you are done
working run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">collectSubmission.sh</code> script; this will produce a file called
<code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment2.zip</code>. Upload this file under the Assignments tab on
<a href="https://coursework.stanford.edu/portal/site/W15-CS-231N-01/">the coursework</a>
page for the course.</p>

<h3 id="q1-fully-connected-neural-network-30-points">Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (30 points)</h3>
<p>The IPython notebook <code class="highlighter-rouge">FullyConnectedNets.ipynb</code> will introduce you to our
modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected
networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several
popular update rules.</p>

<h3 id="q2-batch-normalization-30-points">Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)</h3>
<p>In the IPython notebook <code class="highlighter-rouge">BatchNormalization.ipynb</code> you will implement batch
normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.</p>

<h3 id="q3-dropout-10-points">Q3: Dropout (10 points)</h3>
<p>The IPython notebook <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dropout.ipynb</code> will help you implement Dropout and explore
its effects on model generalization.</p>

<h3 id="q4-convnet-on-cifar-10-30-points">Q4: ConvNet on CIFAR-10 (30 points)</h3>
<p>In the IPython Notebook <code class="highlighter-rouge">ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb</code> you will implement several
new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks. You will train a
(shallow) convolutional network on CIFAR-10, and it will then be up to you to
train the best network that you can.</p>

<h3 id="q5-do-something-extra-up-to-10-points">Q5: Do something extra! (up to +10 points)</h3>
<p>In the process of training your network, you should feel free to implement
anything that you want to get better performance. You can modify the solver,
implement additional layers, use different types of regularization, use an
ensemble of models, or anything else that comes to mind. If you implement these
or other ideas not covered in the assignment then you will be awarded some bonus
points.</p>
