  <p>In this assignment you will implement recurrent networks, and apply them to image captioning on Microsoft COCO. You will also explore methods for visualizing the features of a pretrained model on ImageNet, and also this model to implement Style Transfer. Finally, you will train a generative adversarial network to generate images that look like a training dataset!</p>

<p>The goals of this assignment are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the architecture of <em>recurrent neural networks (RNNs)</em> and how they operate on sequences by sharing weights over time</li>
  <li>Understand and implement both Vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs</li>
  <li>Understand how to sample from an RNN language model at test-time</li>
  <li>Understand how to combine convolutional neural nets and recurrent nets to implement an image captioning system</li>
  <li>Understand how a trained convolutional network can be used to compute gradients with respect to the input image</li>
  <li>Implement and different applications of image gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images, class visualizations.</li>
  <li>Understand and implement style transfer.</li>
  <li>Understand how to train and implement a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce images that look like a dataset.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>You can work on the assignment in one of two ways: locally on your own machine, or on a virtual machine on Google Cloud.</p>

<h3 id="working-remotely-on-google-cloud-recommended">Working remotely on Google Cloud (Recommended)</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> after following these instructions, make sure you go to <strong>Working on the assignment</strong> below (you can skip the <strong>Working locally</strong> section).</p>

<p>As part of this course, you can use Google Cloud for your assignments. We recommend this route for anyone who is having trouble with installation set-up, or if you would like to use better CPU/GPU resources than you may have locally.</p>

<h4 id="gpu-resources">GPU Resources</h4>
<p>GPUs are <strong>not required</strong> for this assignment, but will help to speed up training and processing time for questions 3-5. Please see the Google Cloud GPU set-up tutorial <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial-gpus/">here</a> for instructions. The GPU instances are much more expensive, so use them only when needed. <strong>We only recommend a GPU for Q5 (GANs)</strong>, Q3 and Q4 run in under a minute even on CPU, while Q5 can take 30+ minutes for your model to converge on a CPU (versus under a minute on the Google Cloud GPUs).</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the cloud instance running, make sure to run the following line to enter the virtual environment that we prepared for you (you do <strong>not</strong> need to make your own virtual environment):</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">source</span> /home/cs231n/myVE35/bin/activate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We recommend using Google Cloud with GPU support for the question 5 of this assignment (the GAN notebook), since your training will go much, much faster. However, it will not help at all for questions 1 and 2 (RNN and LSTM), and questions 3 and 4 are still fast on CPU (these notebook should run in a few minutes).</p>

<h4 id="what-do-i-do-if-my-google-cloud-gpus-disappeared">What do I do if my Google Cloud GPUs disappeared?</h4>
<p>You might note that sometimes, your GPUs are no longer accessible on your Google Cloud instance after you restart it. If this happens, please run the following commands in your assignment3 directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get remove unattended-upgrades
<span class="nb">chmod </span>u+x where_are_my_drivers.sh
./where_are_my_drivers.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this isn’t working, you can find more detailed instructions and manual ways of fixing this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/add-gpus#install-driver-script">here</a>. You should follow the “Ubuntu 16.04” instructions.</p>

<h3 id="working-locally">Working locally</h3>
<p>Here’s how you install the necessary dependencies:</p>

<p><strong>(OPTIONAL) Installing GPU drivers:</strong>
If you choose to work locally, you are at no disadvantage for the first parts of the assignment. For the last question, which is in TensorFlow or PyTorch, however, having a GPU will be a significant advantage. We recommend using a Google Cloud Instance with a GPU, at least for this part. If you have your own NVIDIA GPU, however, and wish to use that, that’s fine – you’ll need to install the drivers for your GPU, install CUDA, install cuDNN, and then install either <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/">TensorFlow</a> or <a href="http://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>. You could theoretically do the entire assignment with no GPUs, though this will make training much slower in the last part. However, our reference code runs in 10-15 minutes on a dual-core laptop without a GPU, so it is certainly possible.</p>

<p><strong>Installing Python 3.5+:</strong>
To use python3, make sure to install version 3.5 or 3.6 on your local machine. If you are on Mac OS X, you can do this using <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install python3</code>. You can find instructions for Ubuntu <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual environment:</strong>
If you decide to work locally, we recommend using <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">virtual environment</a> for the project. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed globally on your machine. To set up a virtual environment, run the following:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>assignment2
<span class="nb">sudo </span>pip <span class="nb">install </span>virtualenv      <span class="c"># This may already be installed</span>
virtualenv <span class="nt">-p</span> python3 .env   		 <span class="c"># Create a virtual environment (python3)</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> .env/bin/activate         <span class="c"># Activate the virtual environment</span>
pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> requirements.txt  <span class="c"># Install dependencies</span>
<span class="c"># Note that this does NOT install TensorFlow or PyTorch, </span>
<span class="c"># which you need to do yourself.</span>

<span class="c"># Work on the assignment for a while ...</span>
<span class="c"># ... and when you're done:</span>
deactivate                       <span class="c"># Exit the virtual environment</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that every time you want to work on the assignment, you should run <code class="highlighter-rouge">source .env/bin/activate</code> (from within your <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment3</code> folder) to re-activate the virtual environment, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">deactivate</code> again whenever you are done.</p>

<h2 id="working-on-the-assignment">Working on the assignment:</h2>

<h3 id="get-the-code-as-a-zip-file-here">Get the code as a zip file <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments/2017/spring1617_assignment3_v3.zip">here</a>.</h3>

<h3 id="download-data">Download data:</h3>
<p>Once you have the starter code (regardless of which method you choose above), you will need to download the COCO captioning data,  pretrained SqueezeNet model (TensorFlow-only), and a few ImageNet validation images.
Run the following from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment3</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>cs231n/datasets
./get_assignment3_data.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="start-ipython">Start IPython:</h3>
<p>After you have downloaded the data, you should start the IPython notebook server from the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment3</code> directory, with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">jupyter notebook</code> command. (See the <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/">Google Cloud Tutorial</a> for any additional steps you may need to do for setting this up, if you are working remotely)</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with IPython, you can also refer to our
<a href="/ipython-tutorial">IPython tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3 id="some-notes">Some Notes</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE 1:</strong> This year, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment3</code> code has been tested to be compatible with python versions <code class="highlighter-rouge">3.5</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">3.6</code> (it may work with other versions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">3.x</code>, but we won’t be officially supporting them). For this assignment, we are NOT officially supporting python2. Use it at your own risk. You will need to make sure that during your <code class="highlighter-rouge">virtualenv</code> setup that the correct version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">python</code> is used. You can confirm your python version by (1) activating your virtualenv and (2) running <code class="highlighter-rouge">python --version</code>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> If you are working in a virtual environment on OSX, you may <em>potentially</em> encounter
errors with matplotlib due to the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html">issues described here</a>. In our testing, it seems that this issue is no longer present with the most recent version of matplotlib, but if you do end up running into this issue you may have to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">start_ipython_osx.sh</code> script from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment3</code> directory (instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">jupyter notebook</code> above) to launch your IPython notebook server. Note that you may have to modify some variables within the script to match your version of python/installation directory. The script assumes that your virtual environment is named <code class="highlighter-rouge">.env</code>.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-your-work">Submitting your work:</h3>
<p>Whether you work on the assignment locally or using Google Cloud, once you are done
working run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">collectSubmission.sh</code> script; this will produce a file called
<code class="highlighter-rouge">assignment3.zip</code>. Please submit this file on <a href="https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/66461/">Canvas</a>.</p>
