# R Programming Syntax#

Dear all,

This lecture aims to introduce you the R Programming syntax. You are already familiar with the Matlab and Python programming. You will see that the algorithmic thinking is the main challenge of programming not the syntax. Syntax could be learnt within a week, but not programming. 

R programming have some advantages:

- Open source - Free
- More than enough documentation and courses
- Huge library (not as much as Python)
- Statistical-oriented - So more user-friendly for statistical analysis. 
- Very useful working environment: RStudio
- ...

We will be using R Script in the lecture. Here you will find the explanations for the codes in the R Script.
